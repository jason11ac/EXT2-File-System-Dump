# File-System-Dump
Project 3 for my CS 111 class

For this project, I mounted an image file on my own linux machine and investigated it with debugfs(8). I had to write a program that analyzed the image file and outputed a summary to six csv files describing the super block, cylinder groups, free-lists, i-nodes, indirect blocks, and directories.
